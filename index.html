<p>Created in C#, this can be used to detect onsets (the notes in a song) by using the Spectral Flux algorithm. The Hamming Window Function is also used to reduce false positives. MP3 and WAV files are supported.<br>
Created for an undergraduate final year independent project.</p>

<p>The blue line on the graph marks the current position in the song.<br>
The green line shows the spectral flux.<br>
The red line shows the running average + an offset.<br>
An onset is detected whenever the green line peaks above the red line.</p>

<p>Created using C#, this project is used to detect the onsets (note) in the given track. I used the spectral flux algorithm to achieve this as it’s fairly fast and is relatively simple to implement.I also added in the hamming function, to help reduce false positives, as it was simple and was very quick to implement.
I picked the topic audio as it was an unfamiliar area and I was interested in re-creating games like Audiosurf.
While I initially set out to create a library of audio analysis features, I was advised to focus on one feature in depth rather than a collection of shallow features if I wanted to be graded highly. I chose onset detection as it was a feature that seemed sufficiently difficult to implement.
The project went well, with both of my markers giving me a first grade. The actual code ended up a bit basic as I spent most of the time on the report, which made up 100% of the total grade, though it still works surprisingly well for what it is.</p>

<p>Of course there’s always room for further improvements. The library has issues dealing with background noise, such as live recordings from a concert, some audio filtering might be able to help with this.
The two major improvements I want to add would be to implement multi-band analysis and to make the function iterative.
Multi-band analysis involves separating the audio into different frequency bands (i.e. low bass, midtones and high notes), this would give the developer the ability to separate out the onsets from the drums or bass with the onsets from the vocals.
Re-working the code to be iterative would allow the onsets to be streamed in, as opposed to analysing the entire track at once. This would reduce loading times (especially for long tracks) and would add support for radio.</p>

<p>The video shows how the library performs on a few different genres, sorry for the awful motion blur. The video also shows the development environment I worked in, working in a game-like environment helped me understand the requirements that a game developer using this would need.</p>
